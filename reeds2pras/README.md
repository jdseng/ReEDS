# ReEDS2PRAS

## Introduction

The purpose of ReEDS2PRAS is to translate a ReEDS system into a PRAS system ready for probabilistic resource adequacy analysis.

### Julia Installation

[Juliaup](https://github.com/JuliaLang/juliaup) is a cross platform installer of the Julia programming language.
Detailed instructions to install Julia on different platforms are available from [Juliaup Installation Instructions](https://github.com/JuliaLang/juliaup?tab=readme-ov-file#installation).

#### Mac/Linux

Julia is included in the conda environment, so Julia does not need to be installed separately.
If you wish to install it for testing, you can run:

```shell
curl -fsSL https://install.julialang.org | sh
```

#### Windows

```shell
winget install --name Julia --id 9NJNWW8PVKMN -e -s msstore
```

Then, from the ReEDS-2.0 directory, run `julia --project=. instantiate.jl` to ensure proper installation of Julia and the ReEDS2PRAS environment.

## Basic Usage

If you have a completed ReEDS run and a REPL with ReEDS2PRAS (`using ReEDS2PRAS` after running `add ReEDS2PRAS` in the julia package manager), an example of running ReEDS2PRAS is provided below

```julia
using ReEDS2PRAS

reedscase = "/projects/ntps/llavin/ReEDS-2.0/runs/ntpsrerun_Xlim_DemHi_90by2035EarlyPhaseout__core" # path to completed ReEDS run
solve_year = 2035 #need ReEDS Augur data for the input solve year
weather_year = 2012 # must be 2007-2013 or 2016-2023
timesteps = 8760
user_descriptors = "your_user_descriptors_json_location_here" # Optional - if not passed uses default values

# returns a parameterized PRAS system
pras_system = ReEDS2PRAS.reeds_to_pras(reedscase, solve_year, timesteps, weather_year, user_descriptors = user_descriptors)
```

This will save out a pras system to the variable `pras_system` from the ReEDS2PRAS run. The user can also save a PRAS system to a specific location using `PRAS.savemodel(pras_system, joinpath("MYPATH"*".pras")`. The saved PRAS system may then be read in by other tools like PRAS Analytics (`https://github.nrel.gov/PRAS/PRAS-Analytics`) for further analysis, post-processing, and plotting.

## Multi-year usage

ReEDS2PRAS can be run for multiple weather years of a completed ReEDS run by passing more than 8760 hourly timestamps. For example running all 7 weather years can be accomplished as in the below example

```julia
using ReEDS2PRAS

# path to completed ReEDS run
reedscase = "/projects/ntps/llavin/ReEDS-2.0/runs/ntpsrerun_Xlim_DemHi_90by2035EarlyPhaseout__core"
solve_year = 2035 #need ReEDS Augur data for the input solve year
weather_year = 2007 # must be 2007-2013 or 2016-2023
timesteps = 61320
user_descriptors = "your_user_descriptors_json_location_here" # Optional - if not passed uses default values

# returns a parameterized PRAS system
pras_system = ReEDS2PRAS.reeds_to_pras(reedscase, solve_year, timesteps, weather_year, user_descriptors = user_descriptors)
```

Importantly, the timesteps count from the first hour of the first `weather_year`, so the user must input `2007` as the `weather_year` to run all 61320 hourly timesteps.

## Testing

When CI runners aren't available and ReEDS2PRAS isn't run automatically, it is good practice to run tests and ensure all of them pass before a PR is merged.
It is always good practice to include new tests if the current tests don't cover the functionality you've developed.
You can run ReEDS2PRAS tests by running:

```shell
cd ReEDS-2.0/reeds2pras/test
julia --project runtests.jl
```

or

```shell
cd ReEDS-2.0/reeds2pras/test
julia --project
```

```julia
include("runtests.jl")
```

The tests include PRAS SystemModel building tests and PRAS and ReEDS2PRAS benchmark tests.
If your changes increase the benchmark time by a significant amount, that might be worth investigating.

Typical successful tests summary would look something like this:

## Contributing Guidelines

It is always a good practice to follow the Julia Style Guide (`https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/style-guide/`).
Please make sure you format your code to follow our guidelines using the snippet below before you open a PR:

```shell
julia -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.add("JuliaFormatter"); using JuliaFormatter; include(".github/workflows/formatter-code.jl")'
```

**NOTE: You have to run the snippet above at the repo folder level.
