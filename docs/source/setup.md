# Getting Started 
The ReEDS model source code is available at no cost from the National Laboratory of the Rockies (NLR). The ReEDS model can be downloaded or cloned from [https://github.com/ReEDS-Model/ReEDS](https://github.com/ReEDS-Model/ReEDS).

New users may also wish to start with some ReEDS training videos which are available on the [NLR YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/aGj3Jnspk9M?si=iqCRNn5MbGZc8ZIO).


## Installation Guide
### Windows Command Line
The setup and execution of the ReEDS model can be accomplished using a command-line interpreter application and launching a command line interface (referred to as a "terminal window" in this documentation). For example, initiating the Windows Command Prompt application, i.e., cmd.exe, will launch a terminal window {numref}`figure-windows-command-prompt`. (Note: If you encounter issues using command prompt, try using anaconda prompt or a git bash window)

```{figure} figs/readme/cmd-prompt.png
:name: figure-windows-command-prompt

```

**SUGGESTION:** use a command line emulator such as ConEmu ([https://conemu.github.io/](https://conemu.github.io/)) for a more user-friendly terminal. The screenshots of terminal windows shown in this document are taken using ConEmu.

**IMPORTANT:** Users should exercise Administrative Privileges when installing software. For example, right click on the installer executable for one of the required software (e.g., Anaconda3-2019.07-Windows-x86\_64.exe) and click on "Run as administrator" ({numref}`figure-run-as-admin`). Alternatively, right click on the executable for the command line interface (e.g., Command Prompt) and click on "Run as administrator" ({numref}`figure-run-as-admin-2`). Then run the required software installer executables from the command line.

```

```{figure} figs/readme/run-as-admin-2.png
:name: figure-run-as-admin-2

```

### Python Configuration
#### Windows
Install Anaconda: [https://www.anaconda.com/download](https://www.anaconda.com/download).

**IMPORTANT** : Be sure to download the Windows version of the installer.

Add Python to the "path" environment variable:

1. In the Windows start menu, search for "environment variables" and click "Edit the system environment variables" ({numref}`figure-search-env-var`). This will open the "System Properties" window ({numref}`figure-sys-prop-win`).

```{figure} figs/readme/search-env-var.png
:name: figure-search-env-var

```

```{figure} figs/readme/sys-prop-win.png
:name: figure-sys-prop-win

Screenshot of the "System Properties" window.
```


2. Click the "Environment Variables" button on the bottom right of the window ({numref}`figure-sys-prop-win`). This will open the "Environment Variables" window ({numref}`figure-env-var-wind`).


```{figure} figs/readme/env-var-win.png
:name: figure-env-var-wind

Edit the Path environment variable
```


3. Highlight the Path variable and click "Edit" ({numref}`figure-env-var-wind`). This will open the "Edit environment variable" window ({numref}`figure-edit-env-var-win`).

```{figure} figs/readme/edit-env-var-win.png
:name: figure-edit-env-var-win

Append the Path environment
```


4. Click "New" ({numref}`figure-edit-env-var-win`) and add the directory locations for \Anaconda\ and \Anaconda\Scripts to the environment path.

**IMPORTANT** : Test the Python installation from the command line by typing "python" (no quotes) in the terminal window. The Python program should initiate ({numref}`figure-python-test`).

```{figure} figs/readme/py-test.png
:name: figure-python-test

Screenshot of a test of Python in the terminal window
```

#### MacOS
Download the latest version of Anaconda: [https://www.anaconda.com/download](https://www.anaconda.com/download)

**IMPORTANT**: Make sure to download the Intel version even if your machine has an Apple Silicon / ARM processor. 

```{figure} figs/readme/anaconda-intel.png
:name: figure-anaconda-intel
```

During Installation, select to install Anaconda for your machine only.

```{figure} figs/readme/anaconda-install-mac.png
:name: figure-anaconda-install-mac

Image of Anaconda Install Mac
```

To have the installer automatically add anaconda to PATH, ensure that you've selected the box to "Add conda initialization to the shell"

```{figure} figs/readme/anaconda-custom-install-mac.png
:name: figure-anaconda-custom-install-mac

Image of Anaconda Install Mac - Customize Installation Type
```

**To validate Python was installed properly** execute the following command from a new terminal (without quotes): "python"

Python should initiate, looking similar to {numref}`figure-python-test`.


#### Conda Environment Setup

It is highly recommended to run ReEDS using the conda environment provided in the repository. This environment (named `reeds2`) is specified by the `environment.yml` and can be built with the following command - make sure you navigate to the ReEDS repository from terminal first: 

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

You can verify that the environment was successfully created using the following (you should see `reeds2` in the list):

```
conda env list
```

When creating the reeds2 environment locally, you might run into an SSL error that looks like: `CondaSSLError: Encountered an SSL error. Most likely a certificate verification issue.` To resolve this issue, run the following command before creating the environment again: `conda config --set ssl_verify false`.


### GAMS Configuration
NLR uses GAMS versions 51.3.0 and 49.6.0; however, older versions might also work. A valid GAMS license must be installed.

1. Install GAMS: [https://www.gams.com/download/](https://www.gams.com/download/)
    **If installing on Mac:** on the "Installation" page, click "customize" and ensure the box to "Add GAMS to PATH" is checked.

    ```{figure} figs/readme/gams-install-mac.png
    :name: figure-gams-install-mac

    Image of GAMS Install Mac
    ```

2. Add GAMS to the PATH environment variable. **This step can be skipped if you're on Mac and added GAMS to the path in step 1.**
   1. Follow the same instructions for adding Python to the path in the [Python Configuration](#python-configuration) section above. Append the environment path with the directory location for the _gams.exec_ application (e.g., C:\GAMS\win64\34).

3. Test the GAMS installation from the command line by typing `gams`. The GAMS program should initiate ({numref}`figure-gams-test`).

```{figure} figs/readme/gams-test.png
:name: figure-gams-test

Screenshot of a test of GAMS from the terminal window
```

### Repository Setup
The ReEDS source code is hosted on GitHub: [https://github.com/ReEDS-Model/ReEDS](https://github.com/ReEDS-Model/ReEDS)

1. Install Git Large File Storage, instructions can be found here: [Installing Git Large File Storage](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/installing-git-large-file-storage)

2. From the Git command line run the following command to enable large file storage.
```
git lfs install
```

3. Clone the ReEDS-2.0 repository on your desktop. Alternatively, download a ZIP from GitHub ({numref}`figure-github-download`).

```{figure} figs/readme/github-download.png
:name: figure-github-download

```

### ReEDS2PRAS, Julia, and Stress Periods Setup
Julia will need to be installed and set up to successfully run the model since ReEDS uses stress periods by default. To get Julia and stress periods set up: 

1. Install Julia
   1. [max/linux]: Julia is included in the conda environment so no additional installation is needed
   2. [windows]: install Julia from [https://julialang.org/downloads/](https://julialang.org/downloads/)

2. Navigate to the ReEDS-2.0 directory from the command line, then run `julia --project=. instantiate.jl`

#### Troubleshooting Issues with Julia Setup 
When setting up julia on Windows, you may run into some issues when running `julia --project=. instantiate.jl`. The following steps can be followed to help resolve issues and get julia set up successfully: 
1. Manually install [Random123](https://github.com/JuliaRandom/Random123.jl) 

2. Re-run `julia --project=. instantiate.jl`

If that doesn't resolve the issue, the following may help: 
1. If you previously installed julia, uninstall it: `winget uninstall julia`

2. Manually install [Julia 1.8.5](https://julialang.org/downloads/oldreleases/#:~:text=ea85e0489c36324c4da62163aa1b82fcf2f52f72d173ee7dd213a3a92992cab7-,Windows,-x86_64)

3. Add the julia bin path to your environment PATH variable

4. Install [MinGW](https://www.mingw-w64.org/downloads/) 

5. Open the julia interactive command line: `julia`

6. Enter the julia package manager by pressing `]`, then run the following commands:
    * `add Random123`   
    * `registry add https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General.git`
    * `registry add https://github.com/NatLabRockies/JuliaRegistries.git`
    * `instantiate`

7. Leave the package manager by pressing backspace or Ctrl+C

8. Run the following commands to finish setup: 
    * `import PRAS`
    * `import TimeZones`
    * `TimeZones.build()`

9. You can then leave the julia command line by typing `exit()`

**If you're experiencing issues on Mac, a possible solution is:**
1. Update the version of julia

2. Create the 'reeds2' conda environment with the environment.yml file

3. Run `julia` from the terminal to open the interactive command line

4. Run `import Pkg; Pkg.add("PRAS")`

5. Run `Pkg.add("TimeZones")`

6. Exit julia with the command `exit()`, then run `julia instantiate.jl`

7. Manually move the Manifest.toml file from the julia environment (~/miniconda3/envs/reeds2/share/julia/environments/reeds2/Manifest.toml) to the ReEDS repo

## Running ReEDS

**Quick Start:**
1. Navigate to the ReEDS directory from the command line
2. Activate environment: `conda activate reeds2`
3. Run the model: `python runbatch.py`
4. Follow the prompts for batch configuration
5. Check for a successful run: 
   1. Look for CSV files in `runs/[batchname_scenario]/outputs` (a successful run should have 100+ csv files in the outputs folder)
   2. Verify the reporting folders ("reeds-report", "reeds-report-reduced") exist in the outputs folder

### Understanding cases.csv
Switches are set in the cases.csv file and need to be specified by the user. The default case configuration is called "cases.csv".

General structure: 
- Column A: Model switches
- Column B: Switch descriptions
- Column C: Available choices (**note:** this is not available for all switches)
- Column D: Default values
- Column E: Your case configuration

**Note:** all monetary switches should be entered in 2004 dollars.

```{figure} figs/readme/cases-csv.png
:name: figure-cases-csv

Screenshot of cases.csv
```

**Additional cases_*.csv files:** 
- cases_standardscenarios.csv: contains all scenarios used for Standard Scenarios
- cases_test.csv: contains a group of "test" scenarios that are used to test various capabilities

The user may also create custom case configuration files by using the suffix in the file name (e.g., "cases_smalltests.csv"). It should follow the same column formatting as cases.csv, but does not need to include all available switches.
