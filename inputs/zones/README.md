# Model zone definitions

Model zones are defined by the following user-generated files:

- `county2zone.csv`: Maps from counties (`FIPS` column) to ReEDS zones (`ba` column)
- `hierarchy.csv`: Maps from ReEDS zones (`r` column) to the larger region hierarchy levels
- `b2b.csv`: Back-to-back converter (B2B) capacity [MW] between model zones
- `newlinks_offshore_radial.csv`: Candiate connections between offshore and coastal land-based zones
- TEMPORARY 20260402: `hierarchy_from134.csv`: The legacy-formatted `hierarchy.csv` file from the 134-zone version of ReEDS (will be removed once the rest of the spatial input processing is updated)

And the following automatically generated files:

- `interfaces_r.csv`: Lists the pairs of zones that are connected by alternating current (AC) transmission lines
  - Specific to a nodal dataset (e.g., NARIS); changing the nodal dataset
  (which may entail adding lines or shifting the estimated substation locations)
  can change the set of connected interfaces, particularly for small or sparsely connected zones
- `interfaces_transgrp.csv`: The same as `interfaces_r.csv` but for the larger `transgrp` regions defined in `hierarchy.csv`
- `zonehash.csv`: The string identifier and node lat/lon for each model zone.
The lat/lon is used for plotting, representative least-cost paths and greenfield costs, and interzonal distances for losses and TW-mile calculations.
  - If the centroid is within the polygon defining a zone, the centroid is used as the node location.
  - If the centroid is NOT within the zone polygon, the node location is the "most interior" point in the polygon
  (determined by iteratively inward-buffering the polygon until it disappears, then keeping the centroid of the penultimate iteration).

## Creating a new set of model zones

Start by copying the `county2zone.csv` and `hierarchy.csv` file for an existing set of zones to a new folder (named with a memorable name for your new set of zones) in the [ReEDS_Input_Processing/zones](https://github.com/ReEDS-Model/ReEDS_Input_Processing/tree/main/zones) directory.


### Deciding on the zones

The [ReEDS_Input_Processing/zones/make_maps.py](https://github.com/ReEDS-Model/ReEDS_Input_Processing/tree/main/zones/make_maps.py) script creates a collection of static and interactive maps based on the user-supplied `county2zone.csv` and `hierarchy.csv` files, intended to help decide on the new zone boundaries.
These maps show the new zones alongside existing grid features (transmission lines and planning area boundaries from various sources) and geographic features (mountain ranges).
Maps are also created to show the average load and sum of existing generation capacity by zone.
The resulting static maps are saved to a `.pptx` file, and an interactive/zoomable map is saved to a `.html` file.


### Generating the rest of the inputs

Once you're happy with your zone and hierarchy level definitions, run the following processing steps:

1. Run the [TSC/analysis/make_zone_shapefiles.py](https://github.nrel.gov/ReEDS/TSC/blob/pb/itldb/analysis/make_zone_shapefiles.py) script.
    - This script creates:
        - Zone shapefiles at the `r` and `transgrp` resolutions
        - Lists of interfaces at the `r` and `transgrp` resolutions that are connected by AC transmission lines
        - Maps of existing back-to-back (B2B) converters, to help decide which zonal interfaces to assign their capacity to.
        (Because some zone definitions put the interconnection seams quite far from their actual locations, this step is not automated and relies on user judgment.)
    - It also checks to make sure the user-specified `interconnect` for each zone matches the interconnection for the majority of network buses located within that zone.
1. Calculate the AC interface transfer limits (ITLs) by running [TSC/interfacemax.py](https://github.nrel.gov/ReEDS/TSC/blob/pb/itldb/interfacemax.py)
    - Include the `--dbpath={path/to/ITL folder}` argument and point it to the existing directory of ITLs to avoid recalculating ITLs for interfaces that already have data
1. Write the resulting files to the ReEDS repo by running [TSC/analysis/write_for_reeds.py](https://github.nrel.gov/ReEDS/TSC/blob/pb/itldb/analysis/write_for_reeds.py). This script:
    - Copies the `interface_r.csv` and `interface_transgrp.csv` files
    - Creates the `zonehash.csv` file
    - Rewrites the `itl_NARIS.csv` file (existing data in the file are preserved, so you should only see new rows added to the bottom of the file)
1. Add the new zone definition to the choices for the `GSw_ZoneSet` switch in `cases.csv`
1. To make sure it worked (or just to read the ITLs in general), you can run `import reeds` and then `reeds.inputs.get_itls(GSw_ZoneSet='your new zoneset name')` in Python with the `reeds2` conda environment activated.
1. Try a ReEDS run.
    - The following checks will be performed; if any of them fail, the run will stop.
        - `b2b.csv`, `county2zone.csv`, `hierarchy.csv`, `zonehash.csv`, `interfaces_r.csv`, and `interfaces_transgrp.csv` should all be preset in the `inputs/zones/{GSw_ZoneSet}` folder
        - All the interfaces specified by `interfaces_r.csv`, and `interfaces_transgrp.csv` should have data in `itl_NARIS.csv`
        - `hierarchy.csv` should have all the required columns (`st`, `interconnect`, `transreg`, `transgrp`, and `nercr`)

## Additional input files

- `county_state.csv`: Mapping from 5-digit county FIPS codes to county names and 2-letter state abbreviations.

- `hierarchy_offshore.csv`: Spatial hierarchy levels for offshore zones.
Only used when `GSw_OffshoreZones = 1`.
The offshore zones are not user-adjustable.

- `state_groups.csv`: Spatial hierarchy levels defined by groups of states.
  - `country`: Nation
  - `cendiv`: [Census divisions](https://www2.census.gov/geo/pdfs/maps-data/maps/reference/us_regdiv.pdf)
  - `usda_region`: [USDA Farm Production Regions](https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/arms-farm-financial-and-crop-production-practices/documentation)
  - `h2ptcreg`: Hydrogen tax credit regions ([DOE 2023, Figure 2](https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2023-12/greet-manual_2023-12-20.pdf))
